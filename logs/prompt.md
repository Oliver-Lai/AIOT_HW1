# 第一個prompt
You are to act as a coding assistant that will help me build a project step by step. 
The project must follow the CRISP-DM framework, allow adjustable parameters for y=ax+b+noise data generation, 
provide a Streamlit or Flask web interface for deployment, and record each prompt used in the process. 
Follow the structure and style similar to this repo: https://github.com/huanchen1107/20250920_AutoDeployLR

Step 1: Project Setup
- Initialize a project folder with the following structure:
  - README.md
  - requirements.txt
  - src/
    - data_generation.py
    - model.py
    - app.py
    - utils.py
  - logs/
    - prompts.log
  - notebooks/
    - exploration.ipynb
- Make sure the repo has a clear CRISP-DM section in README.md (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment).

Step 2: Data Generation (CRISP-DM - Data Preparation)
- Implement `data_generation.py` with a function to generate synthetic data using y = ax + b + noise.
- Allow the user to modify parameters: a, b, noise level, number of points.

Step 3: Model (CRISP-DM - Modeling)
- In `model.py`, implement a simple linear regression model (can use sklearn).
- Include train and evaluate functions.

Step 4: Web Deployment (CRISP-DM - Deployment)
- In `app.py`, create a simple web interface using Streamlit (preferred) or Flask as fallback.
- User should be able to input parameters (a, b, noise, number of points), generate data, fit the model, and visualize results.
- Deploy-ready structure.

Step 5: Logging (Prompt Tracking)
- In `utils.py`, create a function that appends each Claude prompt (and timestamp) into `logs/prompts.log`.

Step 6: Documentation
- In README.md, explain project overview, CRISP-DM phases, usage instructions, and how prompts are recorded.

Step 7: Requirements
- In requirements.txt, include dependencies: streamlit, flask, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas.

At the end of each step, show me the updated repo files and ask for my confirmation before proceeding to the next step.
